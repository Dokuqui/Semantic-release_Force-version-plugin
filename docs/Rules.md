In this version you won't have possibility to force your version to any number or input. Here is some restrictions.
Rules:
1. Maximum could be force by +1
2. Can be forced for example from patch version to minor if there is need of it.
3. You won't have possibility to input for example `0.1.1`, because it will force only minor by +1(for other version same rule)
